          <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I have always harboured a passion for learning new skills and being
            someone who grew up watching the internet change our world and I am
            becoming increasingly aware of how quickly the Internet has become
            an irreplaceable part of every aspect of our lives and therefore, at
            this point of my life, I have decided to switch careers and become a
            professional developer. With programming, I can receive an
            attractive salary, which is essential nowadays also I can express
            myself creatively to work to solve problems for companies, my own
            side projects, or even in a startup! Technology is a wide-open
            field, and there are plenty of job opportunities available in
            computer programming. I am willing to put in 40 hours of my time
            every week during the course which is quite a substantial amount
            considering my duties as a father to 4 wonderful children. In fact,
            I believe Learning to code not only allows you to give machines
            instructions, but also teaches you abstract thinking and
            problem-solving, and Learning programming means flexible hours of
            work since all I need is a laptop and an internet connection, and
            most Tech companies are less concerned with where you are, but
            rather that you get your work done, and that allows me to work and
            look after my family. Having had an introduction to HTML and CSS,
            and having other online courses, I am practising 7 hours a day at
            least Recently I started JavaScript online course I feel I have the
            will and dedication to be an attentive learner in your programme and
            hopefully a successful future developer.
